**Prescriptive Implementation Documentation** — Design documentation that includes clear functional requirements for an activity, including security and other specifications that must be met 

**Organization** — Any logical grouping of human, physical, and information resources such as a company, business unit, or team

**Vector** —

- (1) opportunity for an attacker to exploit a vulnerability in the system, or
- (2) a path by which neglect could result in unintentional negative outcomes

**Guidance** — a concerted documentation effort to help bring about an optimal future without foreknowledge of the implementation details

**Guideline** — atomic element of a guidance document; often includes explanatory context and recommendations for designing optimal outcomes

**Threat** — specifically-scoped opportunity for a negative impact to the organization

**Control** — safeguard or countermeasure containing a clear objective and assessment requirements

**Assessment Requirement** — tightly scoped, verifiable condition that must be satisfied and confirmed by an evaluator

**Assessment** — atomic process used to determine a resource’s compliance with an assessment requirement

**Control Catalog** —a set of related controls and relevant metadata

**GRC** — governance, risk, and compliance; especially a coordinated program dedicated to these elements within a business unit

**Governance** — strategic oversight of an organization and its activities

**Risk** — the potential for loss or damage when a threat is actualized, determined by calculating the impact of an event to an organization and the likelihood of its occurrence

**Compliance** — adherence to an active policy 

**Risk Catalog** — a group of related risks relevant to an organization; used to determine when and how rules are created for the organization

**Policy** — a clearly-scoped set of rules based on an organization’s risk appetite

**Risk Acceptance** — a clearly documented decision to accept an unmitigated risk as necessary or unavoidable

**Finding** — The evidence and opinionated result of an assessment; often used as shorthand for *noncompliance finding*

**Evaluation** — the manual or automated process of forming an opinion on the state of compliance, guided by a set of assessment requirements

**Intent Evaluation** — an evaluation ensuring that a resource is set up to succeed, such as through proper training, configuration, or code

**Behavior Evaluation** — an opinionated observation of simulated or real-world activities

**Opinion** — a firmly held approximation of reality formed within the constraints of an evaluator’s philosophy, perspective, and capabilities

**Enforcement** — an action taken in response to noncompliance findings and their causes

**Preventive Enforcement** — any action that interrupts another process which would otherwise cause noncompliance

**Remediative Enforcement** — corrective action in response to noncompliance in a deployed activity

**Audit** —  a formal, opinionated review of an organization’s policies and posture, conducted at a specific point in time to verify that established requirements are met.

**Continuous Monitoring** — a multi-system process designed to collect evaluation and telemetry data in an ongoing process to better detect malicious action, enable remediation activities, and observe trends over time
