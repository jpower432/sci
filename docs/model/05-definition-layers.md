title: The Definition Layers (1, 2, 3)
---

Layers one through three all work together to equip the [organization](02-definitions.html#organization) for success when sensitive activities are performed.

Beginning with an understanding of the different ways that things could go wrong, Layer 1 contains the documentation of *Vectors* and the corresponding *[Guidance](02-definitions.html#guidance)* that can help prevent negative outcomes.

Building upon Vectors, *Threats* are narrow and specific to a particular scenario. Those Threats document the justification for *Controls,* which provide clear objectives and requirements to guide actors in the mitigation of threats.

As the capstone to enable robust security implementation, Layer 3 prioritizes the *Risks* that an [organization](02-definitions.html#organization) faces and outlines the *Policies* that are necessary to mitigate the most pressing opportunities for neglect, mistakes, and malicious activity.

When these three layers are coordinated in a streamlined fashion, they act as design requirements to accelerate and empower implementation activities.

However, the opposite is more often seen in reality: a failure to properly orchestrate definitions as part of the preparation and/or design requirements will inevitably result in [compliance](02-definitions.html#compliance) being segmented from security. Instead of using [compliance](02-definitions.html#compliance) activities as a strategic part of a larger initiative, [compliance](02-definitions.html#compliance) itself becomes the goal.

As [Goodhart’s law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart's_law) teaches us: “When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.” If we mandate [compliance](02-definitions.html#compliance) for the sake of [compliance](02-definitions.html#compliance), we reduce our own efficacy. For this reason, a deep understanding of reasoning behind these three layers is essential to ideal security outcomes.
