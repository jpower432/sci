## Vectors & Guidance

The lowest level of the model provides high-level information pertaining to cybersecurity. These data points fall into two categories: *Vectors* and *[Guidance](02-definitions.html#guidance)*.

Whether a sensitive activity is in the design, development, or deployment phase, it benefits the [organization](02-definitions.html#organization) to understand the failure modes introduced by the activity. After understanding the failure modes for a process, such as information technology systems, the defensive work can begin.

**Vectors** are (1) opportunities for an attacker to exploit a vulnerability in the system, or (2) a path by which neglect could result in unintentional negative outcomes. When documenting a [Vector](02-definitions.html#vector), it is not necessary to understand the technological intricacies — such as the technologies involved at every step. Instead, the focus is on the opportunity for mistake or malice. These can be documented independently or within a catalog, and may similarly be published as standalone artifacts or alongside mitigation [guidance](02-definitions.html#guidance). An example of vectors can be found within the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

**[Guidance](02-definitions.html#guidance)** is a concerted documentation effort to help bring about an optimal future without foreknowledge of the implementation details. The constituent parts of [guidance](02-definitions.html#guidance), guidelines, do not typically stand on their own, and are most often published as a longstanding *[guidance](02-definitions.html#guidance) catalog*. Each [guideline](02-definitions.html#guideline) often includes explanatory context and recommendations for designing optimal outcomes.

[Guidance](02-definitions.html#guidance) may be written internally for unique circumstances, but it is often developed by industry groups, government agencies, or international standards bodies. Examples include the [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/), [NIST Cybersecurity Framework](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework), [HIPAA](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/index.html), [GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/), [CRA](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/cyber-resilience-act), or any of the [PCI](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/) and [ISO](https://www.iso.org) standards.

[Vector](02-definitions.html#vector) artifacts can be referenced by both [Guidance](02-definitions.html#guidance) and Threats to accelerate authoring and increase fidelity. Similarly, [Guidance](02-definitions.html#guidance) artifacts can be referenced by Controls to demonstrate how a particular [control](02-definitions.html#control) applies the respective [guidance](02-definitions.html#guidance) statement.
