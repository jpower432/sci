title: Adjust "Upper" and "Lower" Layer Descriptors into "Definition" and "Measurement"
---

- **ADR:** 0011
- **Proposal Author(s):** @jpower432
- **Status:** Accepted

## Context

Our documentation occasionally refers to layers 1, 2, and 3 as "lower layers" with layers 5, 6, and 7 as "upper layers." This has not proven to be universally understood, and when images provide a cascading view (with 1 at the top) the terminology becomes actively unhelpful.

## Decision

We will describe layers 1-3 as "Definition" and layers 5-7 as "Measurement"

## Consequences

- All documentation and web content must be updated

## Alternatives Considered

Several alternative terms were debated on a live working session and quickly disregarded.
