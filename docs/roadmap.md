This document outlines the strategic priorities ("big rocks") for Gemara in 2026 and beyond. This roadmap is a living document and is subject to change based on community feedback and evolving industry requirements.
These are high-level strategic initiatives, not actionable tasks. They represent major directions and aspirations for the project.

These priorities were discussed and agreed upon in the Gemara Roadmapping 2026 Workshop, representing community consensus on strategic direction.
We welcome input and participation in future roadmapping discussions—join our [biweekly meetings](https://github.com/gemaraproj/gemara/blob/main/README.md#contributing) to help shape the project's direction.

## 2026 Goal

Moving the Gemara project to a stable ecosystem providing the technical foundation required to build automation tools on.

### Strategic Priorities

* **Stabilize Schemas**: Finalize and publish stable releases for each Layer schema to provide a predictable foundation for ecosystem adopters. *Why: Unstable schemas prevent adoption and tooling development.*

* **Mature SDK**: Release and maintain language-specific SDKs to facilitate native Gemara integration for tools. *Why: SDKs lower the barrier to adoption and enable ecosystem growth. Depends on schema stabilization.*

* **Unify Lexicon**: Contribute Gemara definitions to the OpenSSF Glossary to establish shared terminology. *Why: Consistent terminology reduces confusion and improves cross-project collaboration.*

* **Expand Community Materials**: Launch and maintain the `awesome-gemara` repository to centralize community tools, integration scripts, and templates. *Why: Centralized resources reduce duplication and help new adopters discover existing work.*

* **Publish Model Whitepaper**: Formalize and publish Gemara model for community adoption and standards-track consideration. *Why: Formal documentation enables standards-track discussions and broader industry adoption.*

* **Create MCP Tooling**: Integrate and standardize the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server to support authoring Gemara artifacts via Agentic AI workflows. *Why: AI-assisted authoring lowers the barrier to creating Gemara-compliant artifacts and explores new use cases.*

## Completed Milestones

### 2025

* Establishment of the layered data approach (Layers 1-4)
* Adoption by OpenSSF OSPS Baseline and FINOS CCC

If you have suggestions for the roadmap:

* Open an [Issue](https://github.com/gemaraproj/gemara/issues/new/choose) to start a discussion
* Join our biweekly meetings (see [README.md](https://github.com/gemaraproj/gemara/blob/main/README.md#contributing) for details) to discuss roadmap changes

Changes to strategic priorities require community consensus through discussion in meetings or issues, not direct edits to this document.
