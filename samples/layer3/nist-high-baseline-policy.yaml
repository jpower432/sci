title: NIST High Baseline - SA-15 Development Process, Standards, and Tools
purpose: |
  This policy represents the NIST High Impact Baseline subset for SA-15 (Development Process,
  Standards, and Tools) and its control enhancement SA-15.3 (Criticality Analysis). This baseline
  is designed for high-impact systems requiring comprehensive development process controls and
  criticality analysis capabilities.
