title: "My Security Policy"
purpose: |
  This policy tailors the high baseline security policy with additional controls for
  supply chain security (NIST 800-161) and open source project security (OSPS Baseline).
  It is designed for systems requiring enhanced security posture including supply chain
  risk management and open source component security.

                When an official release is created, that release MUST be signed or
                accounted for in a signed manifest including each asset's
                cryptographic hashes. This extends NIST 800-161 SR-4 requirements for
                component authenticity verification.
              applicability: ["Maturity Level 2", "Maturity Level 3"]
              recommendation: "Sign all released software assets with cryptographic signatures (GPG, Sigstore, or SLSA attestations)"

  noncompliance-consequence: |
    Noncompliance with robust baseline controls will result in:
    1. Blocking of deployments for critical and high severity controls
    2. Escalation to CISO for supply chain security violations
    3. Mandatory remediation within 30 days for medium severity controls
