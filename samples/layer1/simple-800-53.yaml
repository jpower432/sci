  title: Development Process, Standards, and Tools
  family-id: SA
  objective: |
    Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to follow
    a documented development process that explicitly addresses security and privacy requirements;
    identifies the standards and tools used in the development process; documents the specific
    tool options and tool configurations used in the development process; documents, manages,
    and ensures the integrity of changes to the process and/or tools used in development;
    and requires review of the development process, standards, tools, tool options, and tool
    configurations to determine if they can satisfy organization-defined security and privacy
    requirements.

    title: Documented Development Process Requirements
    text: |
      Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to follow a
      documented development process that: explicitly addresses security and privacy requirements;
      identifies the standards and tools used in the development process; documents the specific
      tool options and tool configurations used in the development process; and documents,
      manages, and ensures the integrity of changes to the process and/or tools used in development.
  - id: SA-15.b
    title: Review Development Process and Tools
    text: |
      Review the development process, standards, tools, tool options, and tool configurations
      at organization-defined frequency to determine if the process, standards, tools, tool
      options and tool configurations selected and employed can satisfy organization-defined
      security and privacy requirements.
  rationale:
    importance: |
      Development tools include programming languages and computer-aided design systems.
      Reviews of development processes include the use of maturity models to determine the
      potential effectiveness of such processes. Maintaining the integrity of changes to tools
      and processes facilitates effective supply chain risk assessment and mitigation. Such
      integrity requires configuration control throughout the system development life cycle
      to track authorized changes and prevent unauthorized changes.
    goals:
    - Ensure development processes address security and privacy requirements
    - Maintain visibility into development standards and tools
    - Control changes to development processes and tools
    - Verify processes and tools meet security and privacy requirements

  title: Development Process, Standards, and Tools | Quality Metrics
  family-id: SA
  objective: |
    Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to define quality
    metrics at the beginning of the development process and provide evidence of meeting the
    quality metrics at organization-defined frequency, program review milestones, or upon delivery.

      Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to define quality
      metrics at the beginning of the development process; and
  - id: SA-15.1.b
    title: Provide Evidence of Quality Metrics
    text: |
      Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to provide evidence
      of meeting the quality metrics at organization-defined frequency, program review milestones,
      or upon delivery.
  rationale:
    importance: |
      Organizations use quality metrics to establish acceptable levels of system quality. Metrics
      can include quality gates, which are collections of completion criteria or sufficiency
      standards that represent the satisfactory execution of specific phases of the system development
      project. For example, a quality gate may require the elimination of all compiler warnings
      or a determination that such warnings have no impact on the effectiveness of required security
      or privacy capabilities. During the execution phases of development projects, quality gates
      provide clear, unambiguous indications of progress. Other metrics apply to the entire development
      project. Metrics can include defining the severity thresholds of vulnerabilities in accordance
      with organizational risk tolerance, such as requiring no known vulnerabilities in the delivered
      system with a Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) severity of medium or high.

  title: Development Process, Standards, and Tools | Security and Privacy Tracking Tools
  family-id: SA
  objective: |
    Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to select and employ
    security and privacy tracking tools for use during the development process.
  extends:
    entry-id: SA-15
  statements:
  - id: SA-15.2.1
    title: Security and Privacy Tracking Tools
    text: |
      Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to select and employ
      security and privacy tracking tools for use during the development process.
  rationale:
    importance: |
      System development teams select and deploy security and privacy tracking tools, including
      vulnerability or work item tracking systems that facilitate assignment, sorting, filtering,
      and tracking of completed work items or tasks associated with development processes.
- id: SA-15.3
  title: Development Process, Standards, and Tools | Criticality Analysis
  family-id: SA
  objective: |
    Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to perform a criticality
    analysis at organization-defined decision points in the system development life cycle and at
    organization-defined breadth and depth of criticality analysis.
  extends:
    entry-id: SA-15
  statements:
  - id: SA-15.3.a
    title: Criticality Analysis at Decision Points
    text: |
      Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to perform a criticality
      analysis at organization-defined decision points in the system development life cycle; and
  - id: SA-15.3.b
    title: Criticality Analysis Level of Rigor
    text: |
      Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to perform a criticality
      analysis at organization-defined breadth and depth of criticality analysis.
  rationale:
    importance: |
      Criticality analysis performed by the developer provides input to the criticality analysis
      performed by organizations. Developer input is essential to organizational criticality analysis
      because organizations may not have access to detailed design documentation for system components
      that are developed as commercial off-the-shelf products. Such design documentation includes
      functional specifications, high-level designs, low-level designs, source code, and hardware
      schematics. Criticality analysis is important for organizational systems that are designated
      as high value assets. High value assets can be moderate- or high-impact systems due to heightened
      adversarial interest or potential adverse effects on the federal enterprise. Developer input
      is especially important when organizations conduct supply chain criticality analyses.

  title: Development Process, Standards, and Tools | Attack Surface Reduction
  family-id: SA
  objective: |
    Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to reduce attack surfaces
    to organization-defined thresholds.
  extends:
    entry-id: SA-15
  statements:
  - id: SA-15.5.1
    title: Attack Surface Reduction
    text: |
      Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to reduce attack surfaces
      to organization-defined thresholds.
  rationale:
    importance: |
      Attack surface reduction is closely aligned with threat and vulnerability analyses and system
      architecture and design. Attack surface reduction is a means of reducing risk to organizations
      by giving attackers less opportunity to exploit weaknesses or deficiencies (i.e., potential
      vulnerabilities) within systems, system components, and system services. Attack surface reduction
      includes implementing the concept of layered defenses, applying the principles of least privilege
      and least functionality, applying secure software development practices, deprecating unsafe
      functions, reducing entry points available to unauthorized users, reducing the amount of code
      that executes, and eliminating application programming interfaces (APIs) that are vulnerable
      to attacks.

  - id: SA-15.6.1
    title: Continuous Improvement Process
    text: |
      Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to implement an explicit
      process to continuously improve the development process.
  rationale:
    importance: |
      Developers of systems, system components, and system services consider the effectiveness and
      efficiency of their development processes for meeting quality objectives and addressing the
      security and privacy capabilities in current threat environments.

  title: Development Process, Standards, and Tools | Automated Vulnerability Analysis
  family-id: SA
  objective: |
    Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service at organization-defined
    frequency to perform an automated vulnerability analysis using organization-defined tools;
    determine the exploitation potential for discovered vulnerabilities; determine potential risk
    mitigations for delivered vulnerabilities; and deliver the outputs of the tools and results
    of the analysis to organization-defined personnel or roles.
  extends:
    entry-id: SA-15
  statements:
  - id: SA-15.7.a

      Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to determine the
      exploitation potential for discovered vulnerabilities;
  - id: SA-15.7.c
    title: Determine Risk Mitigations
    text: |
      Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to determine potential
      risk mitigations for delivered vulnerabilities; and
  - id: SA-15.7.d
    title: Deliver Analysis Results
    text: |
      Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to deliver the outputs
      of the tools and results of the analysis to organization-defined personnel or roles.
  rationale:
    importance: |
      Automated tools can be more effective at analyzing exploitable weaknesses or deficiencies
      in large and complex systems, prioritizing vulnerabilities by severity, and providing recommendations
      for risk mitigations.
- id: SA-15.8
  title: Development Process, Standards, and Tools | Reuse of Threat and Vulnerability Information
  family-id: SA
  objective: |
    Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to use threat modeling
    and vulnerability analyses from similar systems, components, or services to inform the current
    development process.
  extends:
    entry-id: SA-15
  statements:
  - id: SA-15.8.1
    title: Reuse Threat and Vulnerability Information
    text: |
      Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to use threat modeling
      and vulnerability analyses from similar systems, components, or services to inform the current
      development process.
  rationale:
    importance: |
      Analysis of vulnerabilities found in similar software applications can inform potential design
      and implementation issues for systems under development. Similar systems or system components
      may exist within developer organizations. Vulnerability information is available from a variety
      of public and private sector sources, including the NIST National Vulnerability Database.

  title: Development Process, Standards, and Tools | Incident Response Plan
  family-id: SA
  objective: |
    Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to provide, implement,
    and test an incident response plan.
  extends:
    entry-id: SA-15
  statements:
  - id: SA-15.10.1
    title: Incident Response Plan
    text: |
      Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to provide, implement,
      and test an incident response plan.
  rationale:
    importance: |
      The incident response plan provided by developers may provide information not readily available
      to organizations and be incorporated into organizational incident response plans. Developer
      information may also be extremely helpful, such as when organizations respond to vulnerabilities
      in commercial off-the-shelf products.
- id: SA-15.11
  title: Development Process, Standards, and Tools | Archive System or Component
  family-id: SA
  objective: |
    Require the developer of the system or system component to archive the system or component to
    be released or delivered together with the corresponding evidence supporting the final security
    and privacy review.
  extends:
    entry-id: SA-15
  statements:
  - id: SA-15.11.1
    title: Archive System or Component
    text: |
      Require the developer of the system or system component to archive the system or component
      to be released or delivered together with the corresponding evidence supporting the final
      security and privacy review.
  rationale:
    importance: |
      Archiving system or system components requires the developer to retain key development artifacts,
      including hardware specifications, source code, object code, and relevant documentation from
      the development process that can provide a readily available configuration baseline for system
      and component upgrades or modifications.
- id: SA-15.12
  title: Development Process, Standards, and Tools | Minimize Personally Identifiable Information
  family-id: SA
  objective: |
    Require the developer of the system or system component to minimize the use of personally
    identifiable information in development and test environments.
  extends:
    entry-id: SA-15
  statements:
  - id: SA-15.12.1
    title: Minimize PII in Development and Test
    text: |
      Require the developer of the system or system component to minimize the use of personally
      identifiable information in development and test environments.
  rationale:
    importance: |
      Organizations can minimize the risk to an individual's privacy by using techniques such as
      de-identification or synthetic data. Limiting the use of personally identifiable information
      in development and test environments helps reduce the level of privacy risk created by a system.
- id: SA-15.13
  title: Development Process, Standards, and Tools | Logging Syntax
  family-id: SA
  objective: |
    Require the developer of the system or system component to use organization-defined secure logging
    format(s) to log organization-defined event types at organization-defined level of detail.
  extends:
    entry-id: SA-15
  statements:
  - id: SA-15.13.1
    title: Logging Syntax Requirements
    text: |
      Require the developer of the system or system component to use organization-defined secure
      logging format(s) to log organization-defined event types at organization-defined level of
      detail.
  rationale:
    importance: |
      In support of better incident response and the ability to more quickly reconstruct security-related
      actions, identifying specific requirements for secure logging facilitates the ability to connect
      application-produced audit event logs with operational data. Event types are consistent with
      the event types defined in AU-2.
