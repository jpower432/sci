front-matter: |
  This document provides supplemental guidance for managing cybersecurity supply chain risks.
  It extends NIST 800-53 controls with supply chain-specific considerations and introduces
  new controls for supply chain risk management. This is supplemental guidance that builds
  upon the foundation provided by NIST 800-53, not a mapping but an extension of those controls.

  objective: |
    Providing documented and formalized development processes to guide internal and system
    integrator developers is critical to the enterprise's efforts to effectively mitigate
    cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain. The enterprise should apply national
    and international standards and best practices when implementing this control. Using existing
    standards promotes consistency of implementation, reliable and defendable processes, and
    interoperability. The enterprise's development, maintenance, test, and deployment environments
    should all be covered by this control. The tools included in this control can be manual
    or automated. The use of automated tools aids thoroughness, efficiency, and the scale
    of analysis that helps address cybersecurity risks that arise in relation to the development
    process throughout the supply chain. Additionally, the output of such activities and
    tools provides useful inputs for C-SCRM processes, as described in Section 2 and Appendix
    C. This control has applicability to the internal enterprise's processes, information
    systems, and networks as well as applicable system integrators' processes, systems, and
    networks. Departments and agencies should refer to Appendix F to implement this guidance
    in accordance with Executive Order 14028, Improving the Nation's Cybersecurity.

  title: Development Process, Standards, and Tools | Criticality Analysis
  family-id: SA
  objective: |
    This enhancement identifies critical components within the information system, which
    will help determine the specific C-SCRM activities to be implemented for critical components.
    See C-SCRM Criticality Analysis described in Appendix C for additional context.

  title: Development Process, Standards, and Tools | Reuse of Threat and Vulnerability Information
  family-id: SA
  objective: |
    This enhancement encourages developers to reuse the threat and vulnerability information
    produced by prior development efforts and lessons learned from using the tools to inform
    ongoing development efforts. Doing so will help determine the C-SCRM activities described
    in Section 2 and Appendix C.
