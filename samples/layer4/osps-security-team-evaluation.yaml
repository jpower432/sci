          When an official release is created, that release MUST be signed or
          accounted for in a signed manifest including each asset's
          cryptographic hashes. This extends NIST 800-161 SR-4 requirements for
          component authenticity verification.
        result: "Passed"
        message: "All releases are signed with Sigstore signatures. Cryptographic hashes are included in signed manifests. Security team verified signature verification process."
