// evaluation within the log; and a severity, because a finding a gate acted on
// is negative by nature. Unlike an audit finding, which may record conformity
// as readily as nonconformity, there is nothing to enforce against good news,
// and a waived Critical is not a waived Low. This is the grading of
// nonconformities that certification bodies work to under ISO/IEC 17021-1,
// which #Severity carries. Two actions may act on the same control failure, a
// block and then a remediation, so one log can hold findings with the same

// An effect is not a finding's disposition, which says how the finding was

// that cites an exception leaves it Waived; and one with no effect and no
